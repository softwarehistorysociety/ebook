# Since some books in this project might not use MathJax,
# we disable it by default in epub output, and
# activate it manually on output from the output script,
# which will override this setting.
# (If we don't disable MathJax here, and it is enabled
# in _config.yml, Jekyll will list the MathJax files
# in the OPF manifest of all epubs, even if they don't need
# MathJax, but the output script will not actually copy
# the MathJax files into the epub package.)
