# Variants
# --------
# Set a variant of the work to output.
# A variant lets you override metadata and stylesheets and can be used,
# where `include metadata` has been used, in if statements like
# {% if variant == "somename" %}Variant text!{% endif %}
# Variant names must be one word, lowercase. Hyphens are allowed.
# Add variant book metadata to meta.yml, and output settings here.
# --------------
# Active variant
# --------------
# Add the active variant (defined in meta.yml) to activate it:

# Store settings for each variant.
# These have no effect unless an active-variant is set above.

  # Masthead
  # --------
  # What kind of header do you want in the masthead? Options:
  # project-name, book-title, page-title, breadcrumbs

    content: breadcrumbs
  # -----------------
  # Content accordion
  # -----------------
  # Do you want to collapse content sections in chapters on a
  # particular heading level? Default h2, set in accordion.js.
  # Set this to true to enable, or false to disable.
  accordion: false
  # Enable annotation
  # You can have annotation on for development and/or for live.
  # Set each to either true or false

  # MathJax is activated in _config.yml. Further settings here.
  # At `source` choose local (`local`) MathJax.js or the CDN (`cdn`).
  mathjax:
    source: cdn
  # --------------
  # SVG management
  # --------------
  # By default on the web, we'll inject SVG as img tags into the page
  # so that you can control fonts and other SVG features with CSS.
  # This works for figure and image includes, and any image with
  # a 'inject-svg' class.
  # If you use injected SVGs, make sure their styles are inline,
  # or SVGs may end up 'sharing' styles for duplicated classes.
  # Advanced: see font-switching options in assets/js/svg-management.js
  # Set 'inject' to false to disable SVG injection.

    inject: true

  # -----------
  # Nav element
  # -----------
  # Every EPUB3 must have a nav element, like a TOC,
  # but you are allowed to hide it from view.
  # To hide the 'on the page' nav in epub, set this to 'true'.
  # Then you can put {% include toc %} anywhere in your epub
  # to generate a hidden nav element.

  # ----------
  # Javascript
  # ----------
  # Javascript in bundle.js is included by default.
  # If your epub should not include any Javascript,
  # set disabled to true. This does not disable MathJax.
  # Enable or disable MathJax in _config.
  # You may also want to exclude js in _config.epub.yml.
