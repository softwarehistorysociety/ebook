# Supported classes

Our Classic theme includes styling for a range of classes. You can apply these to elements in markdown.

## Formatting

Use these classes in your markdown to create specific formatting effects.

| Box | `.box` | Block | Puts the element in a box, to set it off from the rest of the text. | No
| Chapter number | `.chapter-number` | Block | Used for a chapter number before a chapter heading. (See the tip at [Bold in the chapter on Markdown](03-markdown.html#bold) for another way to handle chapter numbers. | No
| Dedication | `.dedication` | Block | A dedication, for instance at the start of a book or chapter | No

| Figure: extra small | `.x-small` | Block | Add to the `.figure` tag, e.g. `{:.figure .x-small}`.  | No
| Figure: fixed position | `.fixed` | Block | Add to the `.figure` tag, e.g. `{:.figure .fixed}`. For figures that must keep their position in the text flow, and must not float to the top of the page. | No

| Page numbering restart | `.page-1` | Block | Restarts page numbering from 1. Can be added to the first block element on a page, or to the YAML header, in addition to the main style, e.g. `style: halftitle-page page-1` or `style: chapter page-1`. Recommended for any document that starts a book interior (e.g. title page), to retain correct pagination when creating a PDF ebook with a front cover | No

| Tracking: loosen | `.loosen-1` to `.loosen-50` | Block or inline | Each increment loosens the space between letters by 0.001em (1/1000 of a em). *Affects print output only.* | Yes
| Valediction | `.valediction` | Block | Used for the sign-off at the end of a letter, preface or foreword. | No

## Reserved classes

You may also need to create your own classes for other uses. If you do, avoid using the same already-supported class names above. You should also avoid using the following ones, which are reserved for specific structural elements.

| Class name | Reserved for
|---|---
| `index` | The home page of a collection, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `cover` | A front cover, which will appear in ebook editions, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `halftitle-page` | A book's halftitle page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `previous-publications-page` | A book's list of the author's previous publications, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `title-page` | A book's title page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `copyright-page` | copyright or imprint page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `contents-page`  | A book's table of contents, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `dedication-page` | A dedication page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `epigraph-page` | An epigraph page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `frontispiece-page` | A frontispiece page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `frontmatter` | For other prelim pages not accounted for otherwise, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `chapter`  | A book's default chapter page (and the global default), used for the `style` value in file YAML headers

## The edition suffix

If you want to produce more than one print edition of a book from the same source file, you can't use the same classes that affect text-flow – like `.tighten-1`, for instance – in both editions, because the text will flow differently in each edition.

Our workflow has a way to manage that. In the print CSS file, you can specify an edition suffix. For instance, if you're producing a schools edition of a book, you might make your suffix `-schools-edn`. That suffix will be appended to the end of certain class names for that stylesheet. The default `.tighten-1` class will become `.tighten-1-schools-edn` in your final print CSS.

(It's a good idea to start a suffix with a hyphen and use all lowercase letters, to keep your output CSS neat. Never use spaces.)

Only some classes are affected – see the table above for which ones. The most important are the classes used for tightening and loosening letter-spacing, which are mostly used to control widows and orphans in print layout.

In your markdown, then, you'd use `{:.tighten-1-schools-edn}` instead of `{:.tighten-1}`, and that class will then only have an effect on your schools edition. If you had another edition, say a large-print edition with a `-large-print` suffix, you'd use a `{:.tighten-1-large-print}` tag in the markdown. These would match the classes automatically generated in each edition's CSS.

Of course, one element can carry both classes. For instance, you might end up with a paragraph tagged with `{:.tighten-1-schools-edn .tighten-1-large-print}`. That paragraph would then be tightened in both print layouts.

## Deprecated classes

Early versions of the EBW used the following classes, which are no longer supported:

* `shrink`
* `tighten`, `tight`, `x-tight`, `xx-tight`, `xxx-tight`
* `loosen`, `loose`, `x-loose`
