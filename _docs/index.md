# Electric Book documentation

[Quick start](quick-start.html)
{:.button}

These docs explain how to set up the Electric Book template, how to edit book files, and how to output books. The template includes these docs, which you can turn off in `_config.yml`.

These docs are a work in progress, and not everything is documented yet. You can [contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book), or let us know about problems by [logging issues](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book/issues).
