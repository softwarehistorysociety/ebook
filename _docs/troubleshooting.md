## Markdown

Use a good text editor that colour-codes markdown as you work. We like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (with [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) installed and set to MultiMarkdown) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (with [this markdown highlighter](https://github.com/Edditoria/markdown_npp_zenburn)).

*   If you're working on Windows, set your default character encoding for your documents to 'UTF-8 without BOM', aka UTF-8, and *not* a 'UTF-with-BOM' option. (Jekyll will break if you don't.)
*   To check how your markdown converts to HTML while you work, you can use [this Online Kramdown Editor](http://kramdown.herokuapp.com/) by [Daniel Perez Alvarez](https://github.com/unindented/online-kramdown-sinatra).
*   Keep the [kramdown quick reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) handy.
*   In lists, kramdown lets you use a space *or* a tab between the list marker (e.g. `*` or `1.` etc.) and the list text. If only to solve an issue with nesting blockquotes in lists, *use a tab* between the list marker and the start of the list text, and the same tab at the start of the blockquote line. That is, the indentation (the tab) must be exactly the same for the blockquote to nest correctly in the list. (A local Jekyll instance may correctly parse nested lists even with a space after the list marker and a tab before the blockquote `>`. But GitHub Pages is much stricter and requires exactly the same indentation.) E.g. see our book [Newborn Care 12-5](http://bettercarehealth.github.io/bettercare/newborn-care/12.html#how-can-you-prevent-infection-in-newborn-infants).
*   Keep spans within block elements. For instance, if you have two paragraphs in italic, don't start the italics with `*` in the first paragraph and end the span with a second `*` in the next paragraph. The HTML needs one span (e.g. `<em>` span) in the first para, and another in the second para. The converter isn't smart enough to split your intended italics into two spans. Rather end the first span in the first para, and start another one in the second.

## Jekyll and GitHub

*	When running Jekyll locally, and *if* your repo is a project using GitHub Pages (not an organisation or user site), you'll need to add `--baseurl ''` when running Jekyll at the command line. [Here's how and why](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project-page-url-structure).
*	You may get different results between a local Jekyll install and GitHub Pages, even if both are using kramdown. Always check (at least spot check) both places.
*	Jekyll may break if you use a colon (`:`) in YAML frontmatter like a title. For instance, `title: Beans: The musical fruit`. While you can either use another character (e.g. `title: Beansâ€”The musical fruit` or the HTML `&#58;` for the colon, `title: Beans&#58; The musical fruit`), it's easier to just wrap your title in double quotes: `title: "Beans: The musical fruit"`.
*	We recommend setting `.gitignore` to ignore the `_site` folder, where Jekyll will store HTML output locally. If you choose *not* to `.gitignore` your `_site` folder, it'll contain (and sync to GitHub) your local machine's most recent Jekyll HTML output. (The `_site` folder has nothing to do with what GitHub Pages publishes.) In theory, committing the `_site` folder makes it easy for collaborators without Jekyll to grab a book's output HTML from the repo. But it comes with problems: committers have a responsibility to make sure their Jekyll instance does a good job, and that their `_site` output is up-to-date with the latest changes to the underlying markdown. Importantly, if you have more than one committer on a book, you'll get lots of merge conflicts in the `_site` folder, and this will make your head hurt.
