## Mathematics

Jekyll uses [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/), which the Electric Book workflow supports.

{% if site.mathjax-enabled == true %}

LaTeX-style maths via MathJax:

$$E = mc^2$$

{% else %}

In this repo, MathJax is not enabled at the moment. Enable it in `_config.yml` to see a mathematics sample here.
